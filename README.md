# pyTorch_projects


This repository contains several python notebook files that includes various sophasticated computer vision models and natural language processing techiques.


**PhD__Tasks.ipynb** contains fundamental signal processing techniques 

**finalized_assignment.ipynb** contains various computer vision and image generative models such as Autoencoder and GAN.

**Transformers_Generating_Blog_Posts.ipynb, sentiment_analysis_python.ipynb, NLP_techniques_methods.ipynb** contain various NLP techniques including fundamental to complex

**TAuto_Encoder_predicted_Moa.ipynb**T contains supervised learning method for predicting multiple labels of proteins for particular drug. The supervised method contains two autoencoders. In first stage, efficent low-dimensional features are extracted from genes and cell data. Whereas in second stage, autoencoder is used to predict multiple protein targets or (mechanisim of action) for various drugs.
